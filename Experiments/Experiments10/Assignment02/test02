West Ham manager Slaven Bilic says he is under "big pressure" and in a "very difficult" situation after Saturday's 4-1 Premier League defeat by Liverpool.

Thousands of Hammers supporters left London Stadium early for the second home game in a row as the Hammers were left a point above the bottom three.

"The pressure mounts game by game and at this moment it is big," Bilic, 49, told BBC Sport.

"We will see what the club will do. The club is above everyone."

West Ham have lost three of their past four games at London Stadium and were unable to cope with Liverpool's pace on the counter-attack throughout Saturday's game.

Mohamed Salah scored twice for the visitors, with Joel Matip and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also on target. Manuel Lanzini briefly gave West Ham home by making it 2-1.
